# pybratislava

Repository for the PyLadies Bratislava Meetups.

To run the code from a meetup do the following:
1. Create a virtual environment inside the meetup's directory > `python3 -m venv .env`
In this example the virtualenv will be located in the `.env` directory.
2. Check if there is a `requirements.txt` file. If so install them > `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Check which python files exist in the folder and run them.

To add code to the repo follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a branch and make some changes > `git checkout -b <branch-name>`
3. Commit your changes and write a nice commit message (locally) > `git commit -m "Code for database access"`
4. Push your branch to github > `git push origin <branch-name>`
5. Make a Pull Request to `pyladies-bratislava:master` (in github using your account)
6. Wait for the review and the merge of your changes.
